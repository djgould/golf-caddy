# Monorepo Integration Verification

This document outlines the successful integration of the Expo mobile app with the monorepo
structure.

## ✅ Verified Integration Points

### 1. **Shared Package Dependencies**

- Successfully added monorepo packages to mobile app:
  - `@repo/utils` - Shared utilities including golf scoring functions
  - `@repo/logger` - Logging utilities

### 2. **TypeScript Path Resolution**

- Base `tsconfig.json` properly configured with path mappings for all `@repo/*` packages
- Mobile app extends base configuration, inheriting all path mappings
- TypeScript successfully resolves imports from shared packages

### 3. **Metro Configuration**

- Metro bundler configured with `withNativeWind` in `metro.config.js`
- Successfully resolves and bundles shared packages
- Hot reloading works across package boundaries

### 4. **Build Process**

- Shared packages build successfully using `tsup`
- Turbo caching optimizes build times
- Packages output both ESM and CJS formats

### 5. **Test Implementation**

Created `MonorepoIntegrationExample.tsx` component that demonstrates:

- Importing utilities from `@repo/utils`
- Using golf scoring functions (getScoreLabel, calculateStablefordPoints, etc.)
- Using date formatting utilities
- Full TypeScript support with proper type inference

## Integration Test Results

The test component successfully:

- ✅ Imports from shared packages
- ✅ Uses TypeScript types from shared packages
- ✅ Executes shared utility functions
- ✅ Integrates with existing mobile components

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { getScoreLabel, calculateHandicapIndex, formatDate } from '@repo/utils';

// Use utilities in components
const scoreLabel = getScoreLabel(4, 4); // Returns "Par"
const handicap = calculateHandicapIndex(scores); // Calculates handicap
```

## Commands

Build shared packages:

```bash
pnpm run build --filter=@repo/utils --filter=@repo/logger
```

Add new shared package to mobile app:

```bash
cd apps/mobile && pnpm add @repo/package-name
```

## Notes

- Shared packages are workspace dependencies (linked via pnpm workspaces)
- Changes to shared packages reflect immediately in development
- Production builds include optimized versions of shared code
- All shared packages follow consistent structure with `tsup` for building
