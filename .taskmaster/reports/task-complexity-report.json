      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Monorepo Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the monorepo setup into granular steps: initializing the repo, configuring workspace tools, setting up each base package, establishing TypeScript and linting standards, configuring build/test pipelines, and verifying cross-package integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Turborepo, pnpm, TypeScript, build pipelines), cross-package coordination, and foundational architecture decisions. It requires careful configuration and validation across several layers, making it a high-complexity task that benefits from further decomposition for clarity and maintainability."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Supabase and Database Schema",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the database setup into Supabase provisioning, PostGIS enablement, Prisma initialization, schema design, migration management, seed data creation, RLS policy implementation, and spatial query testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans cloud database provisioning, advanced spatial extensions, ORM schema design, migrations, and security policies. The need for spatial data handling and RLS adds significant complexity, warranting detailed subtasking."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Mapbox integration into SDK setup, authentication, map rendering, overlay/marker logic, offline tile management, performance optimization, and interactive features like tap-to-measure.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating a third-party mapping SDK with offline support, overlays, and performance requirements is complex. Each feature (offline, overlays, gestures) introduces unique technical challenges, justifying more granular subtasks."
    },

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the API server task into Fastify/tRPC setup, context/auth middleware, router implementations for each domain, type sharing, error handling, input validation, and API documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Building a type-safe API server with spatial queries, authentication, and robust error handling is a multi-faceted backend task. Each router and middleware layer can be complex, especially with spatial data and type sharing."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Yardage Calculation System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose yardage calculation into utility creation, GPS tracking, UI components, map interaction, accuracy improvements, and edge case handling.",
      "reasoning": "While the core math is well-defined, integrating real-time GPS, UI updates, and handling mobile edge cases (drift, accuracy) adds moderate complexity. Each aspect can be developed and tested independently."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand shot tracking into state management, UI/UX for logging, offline storage, background sync, round summary/statistics, and data export features.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves persistent state management, offline/online sync, user interface, and analytics. The need for robust sync and error handling increases complexity, making detailed subtasks beneficial."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Shot Planning Visualization",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down shot planning into arc calculation, gesture controls, club distance management, wind adjustment, landing zone visualization, and UI integration.",
      "reasoning": "The visualization requires mathematical modeling, interactive UI, and integration with user data. While not as foundational as infrastructure, the combination of real-time graphics and user input is moderately complex."
    },

      "taskTitle": "Build Offline Mode and Sync System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose offline mode into storage management, map tile downloads, sync queue, network monitoring, conflict resolution, UI indicators, and cleanup routines.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive offline support with intelligent sync, conflict handling, and storage management is a high-complexity feature, especially for mobile apps with rich data and map assets."
    },

      "taskTitle": "Integrate AI Shot Recommendations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand AI integration into OpenAI client setup, prompt engineering, API endpoint with caching, UI component, offline fallback logic, and user feedback collection.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating external AI, prompt design, caching, and fallback logic introduces backend and frontend complexity, as well as reliability and UX considerations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimizations",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down performance optimization into GPS polling, map rendering, memory management, monitoring, React optimizations, and battery usage strategies.",
      "reasoning": "Optimizing for battery, memory, and rendering performance in a real-time mobile app is a high-complexity, cross-cutting concern that requires specialized techniques and thorough testing."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand CI/CD setup into GitHub Actions for test/build, EAS build configuration, Vercel deployment, release automation, and environment management.",
      "reasoning": "While modern tools simplify CI/CD, coordinating multiple deployment targets (mobile, API), environment variables, and automation workflows still requires careful setup and validation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Initialize Expo Mobile App",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of initializing an Expo React Native app with TypeScript into granular steps, including project setup, dependency installation, navigation configuration, permissions setup, state management integration, screen scaffolding, EAS build configuration, and thorough testing on simulators. Ensure each subtask is actionable and can be independently assigned.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple interconnected steps: setting up the project, configuring navigation, managing permissions, integrating state management libraries, and preparing for EAS builds. Each step requires attention to detail and cross-platform considerations, making the overall complexity above average. The presence of several dependencies and the need for robust testing further increase the complexity. Expanding into at least 8 subtasks will ensure each area is addressed thoroughly and can be parallelized where possible, reflecting the multifaceted nature of initializing a scalable React Native app with Expo[1][3][5]."
