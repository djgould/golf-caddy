# Golf Caddy Development Roadmap

This document tracks the long-term development plan for the Golf Caddy app. It complements Claude Code's task management by providing strategic direction and milestone tracking.

## Project Vision
A streamlined golf companion app that provides essential course navigation and shot tracking without the complexity of existing solutions. Focus on reliability, offline functionality, and battery efficiency.

## Current Status (June 2025)
- âœ… Core infrastructure complete (monorepo, database, API)
- âœ… Basic mobile app with navigation
- âœ… Mapbox integration for satellite views
- ğŸš§ Offline functionality partially implemented
- ğŸ“‹ Shot tracking and round management in progress

## Phase 1: MVP (Target: Q3 2025)
**Goal**: Launch a usable app for beta testing with core features

### Completed
- [x] Monorepo setup with Turborepo
- [x] Database schema with PostGIS
- [x] tRPC API with authentication
- [x] Basic React Native app structure
- [x] Mapbox satellite view integration

### In Progress
- [ ] Complete offline course downloads
- [ ] Shot tracking UI and logic
- [ ] Round management flow
- [ ] Basic scorecard functionality

### Upcoming
- [ ] GPS accuracy improvements
- [ ] Battery optimization
- [ ] Initial AI shot recommendations
- [ ] Beta testing preparation

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Target: Q4 2025)
**Goal**: Refine based on beta feedback and add polish

### Planned Features
- [ ] Advanced shot analytics
- [ ] Improved offline sync
- [ ] Course search and discovery
- [ ] User preferences and settings
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] iOS/Android specific enhancements

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Full test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## Phase 3: Growth Features (Target: Q1 2026)
**Goal**: Add features for user retention and growth

### Potential Features
- [ ] Social features (share rounds)
- [ ] Historical round tracking
- [ ] Advanced AI caddie features
- [ ] Apple Watch companion app
- [ ] Course conditions/weather integration
- [ ] Premium tier planning

## Known Technical Challenges
1. **Offline Sync**: Complex state management for course data
2. **GPS Accuracy**: Balancing precision with battery life
3. **Map Performance**: Smooth 60fps with large course overlays
4. **Data Storage**: Efficient caching of course imagery

## Dependencies & Blockers
- Mapbox API costs at scale
- Course data licensing/acquisition
- App Store approval requirements
- PostGIS hosting for production

## Success Metrics
- Beta user retention >60%
- Average session time >30 minutes
- Offline mode usage >40% of rounds
- Battery usage <15% per round
- App crashes <0.1%

## Notes for Development
- Always prioritize simplicity over features
- Test on real golf courses regularly
- Optimize for outdoor screen visibility
- Consider one-handed operation
- Keep offline mode as first-class citizen
